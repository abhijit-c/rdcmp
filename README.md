Matrix-free algorithms for performing the randomized spectral and singular value
decomposition of linear operators. Includes routines for:

- Single/Double pass (generalized) spectral decomposition.
- Single/Double pass singular value decomposition.

Largely derived from the ideas in the below paper.
